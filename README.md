# excel-simulation

With the help of C++ algorithms, the excel simulation software allows users to simulate spreadsheet programs, like Microsoft Excel. This program has been created to efficiently load extensive spreadsheet databases into the terminal making it easier to read and manage data. Through this project users can modify data in cells using a variety of formulas and navigate through the spreadsheet by utilizing commands.

**Overview. The excel-simulation project consists of three core components:**

- Cell: Represents an individual cell in the spreadsheet.
- Excel: Emulates the primary functions of a spreadsheet.
- Terminal: Handles user interactions and operations within the spreadsheet

**Features:**

- File Handling: Supports reading from and writing to text files to persist spreadsheet data.
- File Management: Allows users to seamlessly save edits either directly to the current file or by creating a new, modified version.
- Validation: Ensures that the content of cells and files adheres to defined standards.
- Robust Error Handling: Implements a precise mechanism to identify issues within the text file, pinpointing the exact location and providing a clear explanation of the underlying cause.
- Print: Prints the contents of the loaded text into an easily readable terminal spreadsheet.
- Edit Mode: Allows users to switch between viewing and editing modes for the spreadsheet.
- Formulas: Provides basic arithmetic and comparison operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.
